\section{Black-Scholes Model}
\label{sect:bs-model}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In STAT3905, we have studied Black-Scholes model. It will be studied
again in STAT3910, but in more details. We will consider a more general form of
Black-Scholes model involving the notion of \emph{Brownian motion}, something
learnt in STAT3903. But it turns out that this is still not the ``real'' form.
We will only cover it in full mathematical details in STAT3911.
